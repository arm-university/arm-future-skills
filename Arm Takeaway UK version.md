# Introduction

This document is designed to help you build the knowledge, skills, and
experiences that will prepare you for a successful career in technology.
Whether you’re just starting your journey or already building projects,
it shows you the key skills that engineers and innovators at Arm use
every day, from problem-solving and collaboration to adaptability, AI,
and leadership.

Each skill section gives you:

- **Why it matters** – a big-picture idea about why the skill matters at
  Arm and in the wider tech industry

- **Evidence examples** – practical ways you can show that you’ve
  developed this skill, so you can speak confidently about it in
  applications, interviews, or on your CV

- **How to develop yourself** – suggested projects, challenges, and
  activities that will help you build real experience

- **What to read or watch** – books, courses, and resources to deepen
  your understanding and keep you learning. These include Arm and Arm
  partner materials and additional materials. (Please note that the
  additional materials are not endorsed by Arm. All were checked, live
  and accurate at the time of writing.)

Use this content as both a **checklist** and a **launchpad**: check off
skills you can already evidence and pick out areas where you want to
grow. Try small projects, get involved in communities, and take
advantage of the many opportunities to learn. The more you build and
reflect, the stronger your foundation will be when stepping into
university, apprenticeships, internships, or your first full-time role.

This isn’t just about technical ability – it’s about becoming the kind
of engineer or innovator who can adapt, collaborate, and make a positive
impact on the world through technology.
