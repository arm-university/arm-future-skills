# Arm Future Skills

Want to know what it takes to be at the forefront of tech innovation?
 
Look no further than our Arm Future Skills repository, your guide to the skills and experiences that future engineers and innovators need. Whether you dream of designing processors, building smart devices, coding AI, or leading the next big project, this is where your journey starts.
 
The materials here guide you in building knowledge, skills, and experiences needed for a tech career—showcasing the skills engineers and innovators at Arm use every day (problem-solving, collaboration, adaptability, AI, leadership).
 
It’s not just technical ability; it’s about becoming an adaptable, collaborative engineer who makes a positive impact.  Start your journey towards apprenticeships, university, internships, co-ops or your first graduate role. 

## Purpose of the Documents
This repository contains documents and frameworks that are:
* Jurisdiction-Specific: Files are organized by or refer to specific geographical jurisdictions, such as national or regional education systems. This enables alignment with local curricula, organisations, and industry needs
* Cross-Curricular: While many materials are designed for computing education, others intersect with STEM, engineering, and emerging interdisciplinary areas

This repository is a living resource: content will be developed and added over time, so check back regularly for new materials, activities, and examples

## How to Use This Repository
Use this content as both a checklist and a launchpad: check off skills you can already evidence and pick out areas where you want to grow. Try small projects, get involved in communities, and take advantage of the many opportunities to learn. The more you build and reflect, the stronger your foundation will be.

Each skill section gives you:
* Why it matters – a big-picture idea about why the skill matters at Arm and in the wider tech industry
* Evidence examples – practical ways you can show that you’ve developed this skill, so you can speak confidently about it in applications, interviews, or on your CV
* How to develop yourself – suggested projects, challenges, and activities that will help you build real experience
* What to read or watch – books, courses, and resources to deepen your understanding and keep you learning. These include Arm and Arm partner materials and additional materials. (Please note that the additional materials are not endorsed by Arm. All were checked, live and accurate at the time of writing.)

## Inclusive Language Commitment 
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. 

Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
