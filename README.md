# arm-future-skills
Your pathway to the skills that power tomorrow’s technology.

Arm Future Skills is a resource hub designed to help young people (ages 14–19) build the knowledge, skills, and experiences needed for a successful career in technology. Whether you’re just starting your journey or already creating projects, you’ll find guidance and activities that highlight the key skills engineers and innovators at Arm use every day—problem-solving, collaboration, adaptability, AI, and leadership.

This repository is a living resource: content will be developed and added over time, so check back regularly for new materials, activities, and examples.

##Inclusive Language Commitment 
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. 

Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
